# Unobtrousive

Unobtrousive is a theme for [Pelican](http://pelican.notmyidea.org/ "Pelican home"), a static blog generator engine.

The theme is quite minimal, the basic idea is to build a theme for anyone who wants to have a blog just for writing, thus the attention to typography and readability.


The current layout uses only the following pages.

- base.html
- index.html
- articles.html
- archives.html

All the other pages, like tags, authors and categories, are not reachable form the current layout.

This is the very first release, with maybe bugs and still a lot to do.
